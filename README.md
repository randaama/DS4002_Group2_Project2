# Historical Weather Trends and Retirement

This project is exploring weather trends including percipitation and temperature to see which regions and cities in the United States are best for retirement. 

## Contents

This repository contains instructions on obtaining and cleaning the data used, code that completes and creates time series visualizations, and licensing and reference information.

# Software and Platform

This projected was completed using the R and python programming languages. For R we used RStudio and for python we used Vs Code and Google Colab. The platform used was Mac. If using VS Code to reproduce results, a Python kernel will need to be used in order to use Python and  import the packages used in the scripts.
